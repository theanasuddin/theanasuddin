👋 **Hi, I'm Anas**

#### I love to code!

![I love to Code!](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theanasuddin/theanasuddin/main/banner.jpg)

A software engineer and MSc **Data Science** student at **[Tampere University](https://www.tuni.fi/en)**, minor in **Software, Web & Cloud Technologies**. I build elegant, scalable, and meaningful digital systems, from enterprise‑grade platforms to intelligent data‑driven applications.

Over the past **4+ years**, I've delivered high‑impact solutions for clients in **Finland** and **Japan**, modernized legacy systems, and engineered full‑stack features across ERP, education, and laboratory management domains. My work blends **clean architecture**, **problem‑solving**, and a strong sense of **design & aesthetics**.

----------

## **What I Do**

-   Full‑stack engineering with **Java**, **Spring Boot**, **Angular**, and modern web technologies
-   System modernization: **PowerBuilder → Java Spring Boot**
-   API design, backend architecture, and frontend integration
-   Data‑driven development, dashboards, and analytics
-   Building intuitive, human‑centered digital experiences
-   Cross‑cultural Agile collaboration (Finland & Japan)

----------

## **About Me**

I'm passionate about creating systems that are not only efficient but feel _intuitively right_. My engineering philosophy is rooted in:

-   Clean, modular, maintainable code
-   Precision and problem‑solving
-   Aesthetic, user‑centered design
-   Continuous learning across software engineering & data science

I'm currently expanding my expertise at the intersection of **software engineering + data science**, aiming to build intelligent, human‑centered systems.
